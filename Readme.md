# DataGrid for Blazor - How to create the DataGrid and its columns at runtime

The Data Grid was moved to maintenance support mode. No new features/capabilities will be added to this component. We recommend that you [migrate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403162/grid/migrate-from-data-grid-to-grid) to the [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) component. 

We do not recommend that you generate columns at runtime as Blazor cannot guarantee fixed column order. Use the column [Visible](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridColumn.Visible) properties instead.
